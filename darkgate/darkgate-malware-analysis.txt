now this is very insteresting malware, so after spending some time, below analysis i prepared for simplicity

 Step-by-Step Analysis of DarkGate Malware (independert.msi)

------------------------
 Step 1: Initial Execution
- File Type: The malware is packaged as a Microsoft Software Installer (MSI) file, which is often used to distribute legitimate software but can also be abused to deliver malware.
- Execution: When the MSI file is executed, it triggers the installation process, which is used as a disguise to deploy the malicious payload.

  -----------------------------

 Step 2: Registry Manipulation
The malware interacts with the Windows Registry to establish persistence and modify system settings.
- Actions:
  1. Opens Registry Keys:
     - Uses "RegOpenKeyExW" to access registry keys like:
       - "SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\"
       - "SOFTWARE\EXEMSI"
  2. Queries Registry Values:
     - Uses "RegQueryValueEx" to read existing registry values, possibly to check for installed software or system configurations.
  3. Modifies Registry Values:
     - Uses "RegSetValue" and "RegSetValueExW" to create or modify registry entries, potentially to:
       - Disable security software.
       - Set up persistence (e.g., adding itself to startup entries).
  4. Deletes Registry Keys/Values:
     - Uses "RegDeleteKeyW" and "RegDeleteValueW" to remove traces or disable security mechanisms.

---------------------------

 Step 3: File Operations
The malware performs various file operations to drop additional payloads, execute commands, or modify system files.
- Actions:
  1. Creates Files:  
     - Uses "CreateFile", "CreateFileA", and "CreateFileW" to create new files, likely dropping additional executables or DLLs (e.g., "apdproxy.exe", "msi.dll").
  2. Reads/Writes Files:
     - Uses "ReadFile" and "WriteFile" to read from or write to files, possibly to:
       - Steal data.
       - Modify system files.
  3. Deletes Files:
     - Uses "DeleteFile", "DeleteFileA", and "DeleteFileW" to remove files, potentially to:
       - Cover its tracks.
       - Disable security software.
  4. Searches for Files:
     - Uses "FindFirstFile" and "FindNextFile" to search for specific files or directories, possibly to:
       - Locate sensitive data.
       - Identify security software.

-----------------------------------------------

 Step 4: Network Communication
The malware establishes network connections to communicate with a command-and-control (C2) server.
- Actions:
  1. Connects to C2 Server:
     - Uses "connect" to establish a connection to a remote server.
  2. Sends Data:
     - Uses "send" to transmit stolen data or receive commands.
  3. Listens for Incoming Connections:
     - Uses "listen" and "bind" to open ports and listen for incoming connections, possibly for:
       - Remote control.
       - Data exfiltration.
  4. Pings Remote Hosts:
     - Uses "Ping" to check network connectivity or identify active hosts.

---------------------------------

 Step 5: Process and Thread Manipulation
The malware creates and manipulates processes and threads to execute additional payloads or inject malicious code.
- Actions:
  1. Creates New Processes:
     - Uses "CreateProcess", "CreateProcessA", and "CreateProcessW" to spawn new processes, such as:
       - "cmd.exe" to execute commands.
       - "powershell.exe" to run scripts.
  2. Creates Threads:
     - Uses "CreateThread" to execute code in a separate thread, possibly to:
       - Inject malicious code into legitimate processes.
       - Run payloads in the background.
  3. Terminates Processes:
     - Uses "TerminateProcess" to kill processes, potentially to:
       - Disable security software.
       - Stop competing malware.

------------------------------

 Step 6: Anti-Debugging and Evasion
The malware employs several techniques to evade detection and analysis.
- Actions:
  1. Checks for Debuggers:
     - Uses "IsDebuggerPresent" to detect if it is being run in a debugger or sandbox.
  2. Outputs Debug Strings:
     - Uses "OutputDebugString" to interact with debuggers, possibly to confuse analysts.
  3. Uses Timing Checks:
     - Uses "GetTickCount" and "QueryPerformanceCounter" to measure time intervals, which can be used to detect virtualized environments.
  4. Handles Exceptions:
     - Uses "SetUnhandledExceptionFilter" to handle exceptions and prevent crashes, making analysis more difficult.

------------------------------------

 Step 7: Embedded Payloads
The MSI file contains 4 embedded PE files, which are likely additional components of the malware.
- Actions:
  1. Extracts Embedded Files:
     - The malware extracts these files to the filesystem, possibly to:
       - Drop additional executables or DLLs.
       - Install secondary payloads.
  2. Executes Embedded Files:
     - The extracted files may be executed to perform additional malicious activities.

-----------------------------------

 Step 8: Persistence
The malware ensures it remains on the infected system after reboots.
- Actions:
  1. Modifies Startup Entries:
     - Adds itself to registry keys like "SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run" or "RunOnce".
  2. Creates Scheduled Tasks:
     - Uses Windows Task Scheduler to execute itself at specific intervals.
  3. Installs Services:
     - Registers itself as a Windows service to run automatically at startup.

--------------------------------------------

 Step 9: Data Exfiltration
The malware collects and exfiltrates sensitive data from the infected system.
- Actions:
  1. Collects Data:
     - Searches for and reads files containing sensitive information (e.g., documents, credentials).
  2. Sends Data to C2:
     - Uses network functions ("connect", "send") to transmit stolen data to a remote server.

-----------------------------------------------

 Step 10: Cleanup
The malware may attempt to remove traces of its activity to avoid detection.
- Actions:
  1. Deletes Files:
     - Removes dropped payloads or logs.
  2. Modifies Timestamps:
     - Uses "SetFileTime" to change file timestamps, making it harder to identify when files were created or modified.

------------------------------------------------

 Summary of Malware Behavior
1. Initial Execution: The MSI file is executed, triggering the installation process.
2. Registry Manipulation: Modifies registry keys for persistence and configuration.
3. File Operations: Drops additional payloads, modifies files, and deletes traces.
4. Network Communication: Connects to a C2 server for commands and data exfiltration.
5. Process Manipulation: Creates new processes and threads to execute malicious code.
6. Anti-Debugging: Evades detection and analysis using various techniques.

8. Persistence: Ensures it remains on the system after reboots.
9. Data Exfiltration: Collects and sends sensitive data to the attacker.
10. Cleanup: Removes traces of its activity.

  so this is how the dynamic analysis will help for this. now we can create a hash and check on virus total what it tells from the previous searches... so we can go as deeper as that, but from the initial IOCs, we immediately blocked the 5.x.x.x IP addresses, and the hashes to stop and clean infection from the isolated machines/network-zone.......so, it was an old analysis, but was very interesting, so thought of sharing it.
  
  there are many such interesting forensics we have performed in our past....pls follow the link below to learn more such interesting malware analysis, digital forensics, and how incident response in practically we achieve.....

-------------------------------------------------------------

 Recommendations for Mitigation
1. Isolate the System: Disconnect the infected system from the network.
2. Analyze Embedded Files: Extract and analyze the embedded PE files.
3. Monitor Registry: Look for suspicious registry changes.
4. Block Network Traffic: Block connections to known malicious IPs or domains.
5. Use Endpoint Protection: Deploy EDR tools to detect and block malicious processes.
6. Educate Users: Train users to avoid opening suspicious files or clicking on unknown links.
