 üéØ Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) ‚Äì Deep Dive

> CTI is the analyzed information about an adversary‚Äôs intent, capabilities, and opportunity to compromise a target. It‚Äôs produced from various data points and serves decision-makers.

 üîç Analyze the Adversary:

 Who is attacking (e.g., APT28, FIN7)
 Why (espionage, financial gain)
 How (phishing, zero-days)
 Where from (infrastructure, domains)
 When (timeline of operations)

---

 üß© From the Perspective of the Client (Consumer-Oriented CTI):

 üîê 1. Cyberspace: The Operating Terrain of CTI

Cyberspace is the domain in which all cyber threat activities take place. It is composed of multiple interlinked layers:

 ‚ñ™Ô∏è Physical Layer:

Definition: Tangible components of networks and infrastructure.

Examples:

 Routers, switches, servers, network cables, data centers
 An attacker physically tampers with a router or uses RF attacks on wireless routers (like WiFi Pineapple).

 ‚ñ™Ô∏è Logical Layer:

Definition: Non-physical elements such as applications and protocols.

Examples:

 Operating systems, browsers, cloud services, communication protocols.
 Exploiting Apache Log4j vulnerability in a cloud-based application represents a threat at this layer.

 ‚ñ™Ô∏è Information Layer:

Definition: Actual data ‚Äì what the attacker targets or manipulates.

Examples:

 Emails, chat messages, documents, databases.
 Phishing emails that trick users into entering credentials or open weaponized documents (macro-laden Word files).

---

 üí£ 2. Threat: The Actor and Their Intent

 A threat is defined as intention + capability + opportunity

 üß† Intention (Why):

Definition: The motive or objective of the adversary.

Examples:

 Cybercriminals want money ‚Üí deploy ransomware (e.g., LockBit)
 Nation-states seek espionage ‚Üí target diplomatic emails
 Hacktivists want to disrupt ‚Üí deface websites

---

 üõ†Ô∏è Capabilities (How):

Definition: Tools, tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used.

Examples:

 Malware (e.g., Cobalt Strike, Mimikatz)
 Exploits (e.g., CVE-2021-44228 ‚Äì Log4Shell)
 TTPs mapped to MITRE ATT\&CK (e.g., T1059 ‚Äì Command Scripting)

---

 üï≥Ô∏è Opportunity (Where & When):

Definition: Weakness or entry point that allows the threat to exploit.

Examples:

 Misconfigured firewalls
 Unpatched vulnerabilities
 Users falling for phishing campaigns

---

 üì° 3. Intelligence: From Data to Decision

> Intelligence is processed, validated, analyzed, and actionable information. CTI exists to serve decisions.

 üéØ Primary Goal:

Facilitate the decision-making process for defenders, CISOs, SOC teams, executives, or law enforcement.

---

CTI Lifecycle (with Examples)

 1. Planning and Direction

Definition: Define the questions CTI must answer.

Examples:

 ‚ÄúWhich APT groups are targeting the financial sector?‚Äù
 ‚ÄúWhat are the TTPs of Medusa ransomware?‚Äù

---

 2. Collection

Definition: Gather raw data from various sources.

Examples:

 OSINT: Pastebin dumps, Twitter IOCs
 Internal logs: SIEM, firewall, EDR
 Dark web scraping

---

 3. Processing

Definition: Structure and format data for analysis.

Examples:

 Parsing IOC feeds (convert into STIX or JSON)
 Deobfuscating malware strings

---

 4. Analysis and Production

Definition: Turn processed data into actionable intel.

Examples:

 ‚ÄúAPT29 uses spear-phishing to drop WellMess malware in government orgs‚Äù
 Map adversary's infrastructure using passive DNS

---

 5. Dissemination

Definition: Deliver the intel to the right consumer in a useful format.

Examples:

 Threat reports (PDF, STIX)
 Dashboards (OpenCTI, MISP)
 Alerts to SOC analysts via SIEM

-----------------------------------------------------------

 üß† Cyber Threat Intelligence: Key Terminologies Explained

 üé≠ 1. Threat Actor

Definition: A person, group, or nation-state responsible for malicious cyber operations.

Types of Threat Actors:

| Type           | Description                                                   | Example                       |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Cybercriminals | Financially motivated; engage in ransomware, fraud, etc.      | LockBit, Conti                |
| APT Groups     | Nation-state or state-sponsored; focus on espionage, sabotage | APT28 (Russia), APT10 (China) |
| Hacktivists    | Ideologically motivated; deface, leak, or disrupt for a cause | Anonymous, LulzSec            |
| Script Kiddies | Amateur attackers using pre-made tools without deep knowledge | Defacing school websites      |

---

 üßë‚Äçüíª 2. Persona

Definition: The online identity or alias used by a threat actor to remain anonymous.

Context:

 Used in dark web forums, Telegram, or initial access markets.
 Helps CTI teams track behaviors and link aliases across platforms.

Example:

 A ransomware operator uses the persona "ShadowSpider" on multiple RaaS forums.

---

 üìã 3. Intelligence Requirements (IRs)

Definition: Questions or needs that guide the collection and analysis of threat intelligence.

Purpose: To ensure intelligence is client-driven, targeted, and relevant.

Examples:

 What TTPs are associated with the latest LockBit 3.0 campaign?
 Have any Russian APTs been observed targeting Latvia in the past 6 months?

üìå Best Practice: Define IRs during the Planning & Direction phase of the intelligence cycle.

---

 üéØ 4. Campaign

Definition: A coordinated series of malicious activities aimed at a long-term objective.

Key Traits:

 Multiple operations (phishing, malware deployment, C2 communication).
 May span weeks to years.

Example:

 APT33 launching multiple spear-phishing attacks targeting Middle Eastern oil companies over 18 months ‚Äî part of a larger campaign for economic espionage.

 ‚öîÔ∏è 5. TTPs ‚Äì Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures

| Term          | Description                                         | Example                                                                                      |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Tactic    	| The high-level objective or phase of the attack	  | Initial Access, Execution, Persistence (MITRE ATT\&CK Tactics)                               |
| Technique 	| The method used to achieve the tactic          	  | Spear-phishing (T1566), Credential Dumping (T1003)                                           |
| Procedure 	| The specific implementation of the technique  	  | Sending a malicious PDF via email spoofed from [HR@targetcorp.com](mailto:HR@targetcorp.com) |

üîç Use: TTP analysis helps in actor profiling, defense hardening, and hunting queries.

---

 üö® 6. Intrusion

Definition: Any attempt by an adversary to compromise a system, whether successful or not.

Importance:

 Even failed intrusions provide valuable IOCs, TTP patterns, and threat insights.
 Should be logged, correlated, and analyzed for trend detection.

Example:

 Multiple failed brute-force attempts on an SSH service ‚Üí could indicate a larger scan-and-exploit operation.

---

 üü¢ üî¥ 7. Traffic Light Protocol (TLP)

Definition: A color-coded system for managing information sharing boundaries within and across organizations.

üéØ Purpose: Map the stages of a cyber intrusion to detect and disrupt at each stage
üìà Goal for defenders: Stop the intrusion as early as possible (before ‚ÄúActions on Objectives‚Äù)

 üîÅ Stages:

| Stage                      | Description                                   | Example                              |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Reconnaissance       	     | Adversary collects data about the target      | Scanning for open ports              |
| Weaponization          	 | Malware or exploit package creation           | Creating a malicious PDF exploit     |
| Delivery               	 | Transmission to victim                        | Spear-phishing email with payload    |
| Exploitation           	 | Triggering the vulnerability                  | User opens malicious attachment      |
| Installation           	 | Malware installs a backdoor                   | Dropper installs remote access tool  |
| Command & Control (C2) 	 | Attacker establishes remote control           | Malware connects to C2 server        |
| Actions on Objectives  	 | Executes final goal (data theft, destruction) | Data exfiltration to attacker server |

 üìÑ Real-Life Example: Emotet Intrusion

 Recon: Collected target org emails (e.g., through prior phishing)
 Weaponization: Packed macro-enabled Word doc
 Delivery: Spear-phishing with invoice-themed email
 Exploit: User enables macros
