
 🧪 Memory Leak Detection – In-Depth Explanation

 🔍 What is a Memory Leak?

A memory leak occurs when a program:

 Allocates memory (e.g., via `malloc`, `new`, etc.),
 But never releases it back to the system, even when it's no longer needed.

Over time:

 The RAM usage increases, possibly to exhaustion.
 System performance degrades.
 It may even crash or freeze.
 In malware analysis, leaky malware or injected processes can cause these symptoms, either intentionally (to DoS a system) or due to poor coding.

 🚨 Symptoms of Memory Leaks

 Gradual increase in memory usage (RAM usage keeps climbing).
 System slowdown or high memory pressure.
 Unusual memory patterns in certain processes.
 Tools like Task Manager showing ever-increasing memory for a single process.
 In a forensic case, stealthy persistence mechanisms or process hollowing may exhibit memory leaks.

 🛠️ Tool: Debug Diagnostic Tool (DebugDiag)

 📌 What It Is:

 A Microsoft-provided GUI tool for troubleshooting performance issues.
 Designed to analyze process dumps and detect:

   Memory leaks
   Handle leaks
   Crashes
   Hangs

 🧰 How It Works:

1. Download and Install Debug Diagnostic Tool

    [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/debug-diagnostic-tool-overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/debug-diagnostic-tool-overview)

2. Set up a Rule:

    Choose "Memory and Handle Leak".
    Select the target process (e.g., `chrome.exe`, suspicious process, etc.).
    Attach debugger or start monitoring.

3. Monitor the Process:

    It will monitor heap allocations over time.
    Generates a report with graphs showing memory usage.
    Shows which functions/modules are responsible for memory allocations.

4. Analyze the Report:

    Reports in `.mht` format (open with a browser).
    Look for:

      Steady growth in memory
      Leaked modules or functions
      Suspicious DLLs or threads

 📉 Reading the Graphs

 📈 Stair-step upward or straight upward slope → Memory leak is likely.
 ↔️ Horizontal (flat) usage or fluctuation → Healthy memory management.
 📉 A dip (release of memory) → GC or memory freed properly.

 🧠 Forensic Use-Cases:

 Malware Behavior Profiling: If a malware sample causes memory leaks, it can be a unique behavioral indicator.
 Injected DLL Detection: If memory leaks start after a DLL injection, the DLL may be malicious.
 Attribution of Leak: Maps leaks to the function/module responsible, useful in reverse engineering malware.

 🔐 Security Twist:

 Leak as a Side Channel: In some cases, attackers intentionally leak memory to:

   Create performance issues
   Distract defenders
   Store temporary payloads in memory

---

 🧪 Example in Practice:

Let’s say you observe a process called `notepad.exe` using 3 GB RAM. You suspect it's hollowed and hosting malicious code.

 Use DebugDiag to monitor `notepad.exe`.
 Observe a consistent increase in heap usage.
 The report shows a suspicious module (e.g., `C2Module.dll`) is never freeing memory.
 This gives you direction for reverse engineering and threat hunting.

import time

print("Starting aggressive memory leak demo...")

leak_list = []  # Store allocated memory chunks

try:
    while True:
        # Allocate 100MB of binary data per iteration
        chunk = b'A' * (100 * 1024 * 1024)  # 100 MB binary block
        leak_list.append(chunk)            # Intentional memory leak

        print(f"Leaked another 100MB... Total memory leaked: {len(leak_list) * 100} MB")
        time.sleep(1)  # Slight delay to make the spike noticeable but controlled

except KeyboardInterrupt:
    print("\nMemory leak demo interrupted by user.")
